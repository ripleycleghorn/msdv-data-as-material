    <div id="description"><div class="description-title">About this visualization</div> This chart shows many of the comments exchanged while on dog walks with my new puppy, Benji, during the last three weeks. Each bubble represents a conversation, and hovering over them reveals the comments. I decided to focus on the tone of the comments and also my dog's mood in that moment to see if there were any relations. As you can see, over time the comments had a downward trend, which I attribute to the fact that he became less anxious and started behaving more like a dog i.e. barking more. Also, the most negative comments are associated with an angry mood, as expected.</div>
