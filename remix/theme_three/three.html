				Let’s consider a modest, unremarkable tree — the one living on your street, perhaps. A decorative maple
				tree,
				about the height of a streetlight — not a majestic maple reaching its full height in the forest — a
				demure
				neighborhood tree that’s only one - quarter the height of its regal counterpart. When the sun is
				directly
				overhead, the little maple in our example casts a shadow about the size of a parking space. However, if
				we pluck
				off all the leaves and lay them flat, side by side, they would cover three parking spaces. By suspending
				each
				leaf separately, the tree has stacked its surface area into a sort of ladder for light to fall down.
			</textPath>
			<textPath href="#two">
				Looking up,
				you notice that the leaves at the top of any tree are smaller, on average, than the leaves at the
				bottom. This
				allows sunlight to be caught near the base whenever the wind blows and parts the upper branches. Look
				again and
				you’ll notice that leaves low in the canopy are of a darker green ; they contain more of the pigment
				that helps
				each leaf absorb sunshine, allowing them to harvest the weaker rays that penetrate shade. When building
				foliage,
				a tree must budget for each leaf individually and allocate for each position relative to the other
				leaves.
			</textPath>
			<textPath href="#four">
				A
				good business plan will allow our tree to triumph as the largest and longest - living being on your
				street. But
				it ain’t easy, and it ain’t cheap.
			</textPath>
			<textPath href="#three">
				The leaves on our little maple, all taken together, weigh thirty-five pounds. Every ounce therein must
				be pulled
				from the air or mined from the soil — and quickly — over the course of a few short months. From the
				atmosphere,
				a plant gains carbon dioxide, which it will make into sugar and pith.
			</textPath>
			<textPath href="#main">
				Thirty - five pounds of maple
				leaves may
				not taste sweet to you and me, but they actually contain enough sucrose to make three pecan pies, which
				is the
				sweetest thing that I can think of right now. The pithy skeleton within the leaves contains enough
				cellulose to
				make almost three hundred sheets of paper, which is about the number that I used to print out the
				manuscript for
				this book.
				Our tree’s only source of energy is the sun : after light photons stimulate the pigments within the
				leaf, buzzing
				electrons line up into an unfathomably long chain and pass their excitement one to the other, moving
				biochemical
				energy across the cell to the exact location where it is needed. The plant pigment chlorophyll is a
				large
				molecule, and within the bowl of its spoon - shaped structure sits one single precious magnesium atom.
				The
				amount of magnesium needed for enough chlorophyll to fuel thirty-five pounds of leaves is equivalent to
				the
				amount of magnesium found in fourteen One A Day vitamins, and it must ultimately dissolve out of
				bedrock, which
				is a geologically slow process. Magnesium, phosphorous, iron, and the many other micronutrients that our
				tree
				needs can be gained only from the extremely dilute solution that flows in between the tiny mineral
				grains within
				the soil.
				In order to accumulate all of the soil nutrients that thirty-five pounds of leaves require,
				our tree
				must first absorb and then evaporate at least eight thousand gallons of water from the soil. That’s
				enough to
				fill a tanker truck. That’s enough to keep twenty-five people alive for a year. That’s enough to make
				you worry
				about when it is next going to rain.
